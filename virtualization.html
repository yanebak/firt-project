		<h1>Virtualization</h1>
        <p>In computing, <strong>virtualization</strong> refers to the act of creationg a virtual (rather than actual) version of something.<br>This includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network ressources.</p>
        <hr>
        <h1>Levels of Virtualization</h1>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) level</strong></li>
            <p>Everymachine has an instruction set. This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware. Using this instructions software can<br>communicate with hardware.</p>
            <li><strong>Virtualization at Operating System (O.S.) level</strong></li>

            <p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In cloud sometimes, we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, if we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer<br>(HAL) level this can take too much time.</li>
                <li>So, to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the<br>hardware.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
